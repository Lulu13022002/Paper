Subject: [PATCH] Mob Pathfinding API

Adds an API to allow plugins to instruct a Mob to Pathfind to a Location or Entity

This does not do anything to stop other AI rules from changing the location, so
it is still up to the plugin to control that or override after another goal changed
the location.

You can use EntityPathfindEvent to cancel new pathfinds from overriding your current.
